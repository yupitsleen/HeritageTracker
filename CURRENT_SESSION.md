# CURRENT_SESSION.md

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Branch:** feature/thirdbranchlol
**Project:** Heritage Tracker - Palestinian Cultural Heritage Documentation

## Session Status: ✅ MVP PHASE 1 COMPLETE + MAJOR UX OVERHAUL

## Project Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Document destruction of 20-25 significant Gaza heritage sites (2023-2024)
**Tech Stack:** React 19+ + TypeScript + Vite 7+ + Tailwind CSS v4 + Leaflet + D3.js
**Dev Server:** http://localhost:5173

**Data Sources:**

- UNESCO Official List (110 verified sites)
- Forensic Architecture (satellite imagery, coordinates)
- Heritage for Peace (ground documentation)

## Today's Accomplishments (October 8, 2025)

### Phase J: Vertical Timeline Layout ✅

**Commits:** `44af99e`, `a52d346`, `723056f`

- Transformed horizontal timeline to vertical left sidebar (320px width)
- Full viewport height with independent scrolling
- Removed card background for seamless integration
- Intelligent scroll capture (prevents page scroll when hovering timeline)
- Text truncation with ellipsis for long site names (220px max width)
- Map highlighting now click-only (removed hover-based movement)
- Extended timeline line to fill full height even with few sites

### Phase K: Three-Column Dashboard Layout ✅

**Major Architectural Change:**

```
Timeline (Left) | Map (Center) | Sites Table (Right)
     320px      |   Flexible   |       384px
```

- Replaced card grid with compact scrollable table
- Table displays: Site name (EN/AR), Type, Status (colored text), Date
- Status badges replaced with colored text (no confusing button appearance)
- Synchronized highlighting across all three components with black ring outline
- Click any component (timeline/map/table) → highlights in all others
- Centered all headers for visual symmetry
- 70% space reduction vs previous card layout

### Phase L: Unified FilterBar System ✅

**Centralized Filtering:**

- Created full-width FilterBar above all content
- Custom MultiSelectDropdown component with checkboxes
- Professional filter buttons: "Site Type (3) ▼"
- Count badges show active selections in green
- Fixed positioning prevents dropdown clipping (z-100)
- Date picker moved from timeline clicks to explicit input
- Clear separation: FilterBar = filtering, Timeline = navigation
- Helper text guides users: "Use date picker and dropdowns to filter"

**Filter Improvements:**

- Removed "all" option from constants (empty selection = show all)
- Active filter tags removed (count now in button)
- Chevron icons rotate when dropdown opens
- Click outside to close dropdowns
- Visual checkbox feedback with green checkmarks

## Current System Architecture

```
Header (Heritage Sites)
    ↓
FilterBar (Type, Status, Date) → Controls all filtering
    ↓
Timeline | Map | Table → Display filtered + synchronized data
    ↓
Click any element → Black ring highlights across all three
    ↓
Detail Modal → Full site information
```

**Data Flow:**

1. FilterBar → Type/Status/Date filters applied
2. Filtered sites → Displayed in Timeline, Map, and Table
3. Click interaction → highlightedSiteId syncs across all components
4. Table/Map click → Opens detail modal

**Current Dataset:** 5 sites (need 15-20 more)

## Test Coverage

**Total:** 11/11 tests passing ✓

- SiteCard: 1 test
- HeritageMap: 1 test
- Timeline: 3 tests
- Filters: 3 tests
- App: 3 tests

## Technical Highlights

**Component Innovations:**

1. **VerticalTimeline** - Full-height D3.js timeline with scroll capture
2. **SitesTable** - Compact tabular view with synchronized highlighting
3. **FilterBar** - Unified filtering with custom dropdowns
4. **MultiSelectDropdown** - Professional checkbox-based multi-select

**UX Patterns:**

- Centralized filtering with clear visual hierarchy
- Three-column symmetric layout with sticky sidebars
- Click-based interactions (no accidental hovers)
- Black ring outline for synchronized selection state
- Status as colored text (red/orange/yellow semantic colors)

## Next Session Priorities

### 1. Data Collection (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Collect remaining 15-20 heritage sites
- Verify coordinates and dates
- Find before/after images
- Ensure proper source citations
- **Impact:** Real data makes app meaningful

### 2. Statistics Dashboard (MEDIUM)

- Impact numbers display (sites destroyed, cultural loss)
- Visual breakdown by site type
- Timeline graph showing destruction over time
- Call-to-action for awareness/advocacy
- **Impact:** Compelling landing page

### 3. Timeline Animation (MEDIUM)

- Add "Play" button for animated temporal progression
- Auto-advance through dates showing cumulative destruction
- Pause/resume controls
- **Impact:** Dramatic visualization of escalation

### 4. About/Methodology Page (MEDIUM)

- Project mission and goals
- Data sources and verification process
- How to read the map/timeline
- Legal disclaimer
- Contact information for contributions

## Development Principles

**Evidence-Based:** Every claim must have source citation
**Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance required
**Mobile-First:** Responsive design for all screens (needs work)
**Performance:** Fast loading on slow connections
**Bilingual:** English + Arabic (RTL support)

## Lessons Learned (October 8, 2025)

### What Worked ✓

1. **Three-column layout** - Excellent information density and navigation
2. **Unified FilterBar** - Clear mental model for data control
3. **Custom dropdowns** - Much better UX than native multi-select
4. **Synchronized highlighting** - Single state keeps UI consistent
5. **Table vs cards** - 70% space savings with better scannability

### Technical Wins

1. **Fixed positioning** - Solved dropdown overflow with getBoundingClientRect()
2. **Scroll capture** - Timeline scrolls independently without affecting page
3. **Click-only interactions** - Reduced accidental UI changes from hovers
4. **Status colored text** - Removed confusing badge buttons
5. **Centered headers** - Improved visual balance and symmetry

### Process Improvements

1. **Incremental commits** - Each feature fully functional before committing
2. **Test-driven** - All tests pass before moving forward
3. **Lint-clean** - Zero warnings throughout session
4. **Component extraction** - MultiSelectDropdown reusable across app
