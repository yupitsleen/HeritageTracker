## Critical Development Rules

### Git Workflow

- Main branch is protected
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- Currently on: `feature/firstbranch`

### Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- One component per file
- JSDoc for public APIs

### Quality Requirements

- Source everything - every claim needs citation
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- RTL layout support for Arabic
- Performance optimization for slow connections
