            The Israeli military has conducted systematic bombing campaigns across Gaza since October 2023,
            resulting in widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage sites.
            International law experts and UN officials have documented numerous violations of the laws of war.

            <ul className={`list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-xs ${t.text.muted}`}>
              <li><strong>1954 Hague Convention:</strong> Prohibits deliberate targeting of cultural property during armed conflict</li>
              <li><strong>Rome Statute Article 8(2)(b)(ix):</strong> Intentionally directing attacks against cultural heritage constitutes a war crime</li>

          <p>
            <strong>Documented Patterns:</strong> Satellite imagery, witness testimony, and forensic analysis
            show deliberate targeting of mosques, churches, museums, libraries, and archaeological sitesâ€”many
            with no military presence or justification. UNESCO, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International
            have all documented these destructions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Scale:</strong> Beyond the heritage sites documented here, Israel has destroyed over 60%
            of all buildings in Gaza, displaced 90% of the population, killed over 45,000 Palestinians
            (70% women and children), and rendered the territory largely uninhabitable.

            The United States has provided critical material, financial, and political support enabling

          <p>
            <strong>Legal Implications:</strong> Under international law, providing weapons and material support
            with knowledge they will be used for war crimes creates complicity. The US obligation to prevent
            genocide (established in the Genocide Convention) is violated by actively enabling it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Historical Pattern:</strong> This support continues a decades-long pattern of unconditional
            US military aid to Israel totaling over $260 billion, enabling systematic displacement, occupation,
            and now the destruction documented here.
