 * Centralized Tooltip Content Configuration

 * All tooltip text in one place for:
 * - Easy maintenance
 * - Consistency across the app
 * - Future translation to Arabic via i18n
 *
 * NOTE: Many tooltips use translation keys from src/i18n/en.ts
 * This file contains NEW tooltips that don't yet have translation keys.
 * Eventually these should be moved to i18n system.
