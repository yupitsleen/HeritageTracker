## Single Map Mode (Default) - Simple Satellite View

When you first load the page, you'll see **one full-screen map** showing satellite imagery.

### What You See

**Satellite Map:**
- Full-screen satellite view of Gaza
- Green date label at top: **"Dec 15, 2024"** (or current Wayback release)
- Site markers show heritage sites as colored dots
- Each marker's color indicates status (red = destroyed, orange = damaged, etc.)

**Map Settings (Bottom-Left):**
- **☑ Zoom to Site**: Automatically zoom when you select a site
- **☑ Show Map Markers**: Toggle visibility of site markers
  - Tip: Turn off markers for clearer satellite imagery

**How It Works:**
- Drag the **Wayback Slider** (below map) to change which date's satellite imagery you see
- Map updates to show imagery from that date
- Date label updates to show current selection

### Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. Look at the Wayback Slider (section 3 below the map)
2. Find the **green handle** (scrubber)
3. **Drag it left/right** → Map updates to show different dates
4. Notice the **date label** at top of map changes

**That's it!** You're now viewing historical satellite imagery.

## Comparison Mode - Side-by-Side Before/After

This is where the Timeline page really shines. **Compare two different dates side-by-side.**

### How to Enable

**Click "Comparison Mode" button** above the Wayback Slider

### What Changes

**Two Maps Appear:**
```
┌───────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐
│ BEFORE            │  │ AFTER             │
│ Yellow: Oct 1 '23 │  │ Green: Nov 1 '23  │
│                   │  │                   │
│ [Older imagery]   │  │ [Newer imagery]   │
│                   │  │                   │
│ ☑ Zoom ☑ Markers  │  │ ☑ Zoom ☑ Markers  │
└───────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘
```

**Two Scrubbers Appear:**
- **Yellow scrubber** (below timeline): Controls "Before" map (left)
- **Green scrubber** (above timeline): Controls "After" map (right)

**Synchronized Movement:**
- Pan one map → Other map follows
- Zoom one map → Other map matches
- Select a site → Both maps show it

### Comparison Interval Dropdown

**Located above Wayback Slider, next to Comparison Mode button**

**Options:**
- **1 Day Before**: Before = After minus 1 day
- **1 Week Before**: Before = After minus 1 week
- **1 Month Before**: Before = After minus 1 month (default)
- **3 Months Before**: Before = After minus 3 months
- **6 Months Before**: Before = After minus 6 months
- **1 Year Before**: Before = After minus 1 year
- **Custom**: Drag scrubbers independently

**How It Works:**
1. Select an interval (e.g., "1 Month Before")
2. Drag the **green scrubber** (After date)
3. **Yellow scrubber** automatically moves to maintain the interval
4. Example: Green at Nov 1 2023 → Yellow at Oct 1 2023 (1 month before)

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Quickly compare "immediately before" vs "immediately after" destruction
- No need to calculate dates manually
- Ensures you're seeing the right time window

## Wayback Slider - 186 Historical Images

This is the **core control** of the Timeline page. It lets you select from 186 satellite image releases.

### Understanding the Slider

**Visual Elements:**
```
        Green Scrubber ◉
2014    2016    2018    2020    2022    2024
│││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││││
●────────────●─●────────────●──────●
◉ Yellow Scrubber (Comparison Mode only)
```

**Year Labels:**
- **2014, 2016, 2018...**: Positioned at actual dates
- Spaced proportionally (not evenly)

**Gray Lines:**
- **186 vertical tick marks**: One per satellite image release
- Notice they get **denser** in recent years (more frequent captures)
- Early years (2014-2018): ~4-6 images per year
- Recent years (2023-2025): ~12-20 images per year

**Red Dots:**
- Each dot = one heritage site destroyed
- Multiple dots stack vertically if destroyed on same date
- Click dot → highlights that site on map

**Scrubbers:**
- **Green handle** (always visible): "After" date
- **Yellow handle** (comparison mode): "Before" date

### Interactions

**Dragging:**
- Click and drag either scrubber to change dates
- Map updates in real-time
- Snaps to closest of 186 available releases

**Clicking Timeline:**
- Click anywhere on timeline
- Closest scrubber moves to that position
- If both scrubbers visible → moves whichever is closer

**Previous/Next Buttons:**
- **Previous ⏮**: Jump to previous Wayback release (left)
- **Next ⏭**: Jump to next Wayback release (right)
- Works on whichever scrubber was moved last

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Move to previous/next release
- **PageUp/PageDown**: Jump 10 releases
- **Home**: First release (2014)
- **End**: Last release (2025)

**Tooltips:**

## Advanced Techniques

### Finding the Best Imagery

**Problem:** Sometimes imagery is cloudy or low-resolution.

**Solution:**
1. Look at gray tick marks on Wayback Slider
2. Notice how they're denser in recent years
3. For recent events (2023+), try multiple nearby releases
4. Use Previous/Next buttons to step through options
5. Pick the clearest imagery

### Investigating Gradual Damage

**Problem:** Site wasn't destroyed in one event - damage occurred over months.

**Solution:**
1. Turn OFF "Sync map on dot click"
2. Manually drag green scrubber through time
3. Watch the site change step by step
4. Note when damage first appears, worsens, etc.
5. In Comparison Mode, keep yellow scrubber at "initial intact" and move green scrubber forward

### Documenting Multiple Sites in One Area

**Problem:** Want to compare destruction in a specific neighborhood.

**Solution:**
1. Use Filter Bar → Search for neighborhood name
2. Zoom to that area on maps
3. Turn OFF "Zoom to Site" (so map doesn't jump when you click sites)
4. Click through red dots on timeline
5. Sites highlight one by one, but map stays on same area
6. Take screenshots for each site with before/after imagery

### Creating a Presentation

**Problem:** Need before/after images for a report.

**Solution:**
1. Enable Comparison Mode
2. Select site from Site Timeline
3. Adjust Comparison Interval to show desired time window
4. Use Previous/Next to find clearest imagery
5. Take screenshot (Ctrl+Shift+S in most browsers)
6. Repeat for other sites
7. Click site name → Opens modal with full details and sources
8. Copy source citations for attribution

## Common Questions

### "Why are some dates missing?"

**186 satellite releases** means ~186 specific dates from 2014-2025.

- **Not every day** has imagery (satellites don't capture daily)
- **Early years** have fewer captures (4-6 per year)
- **Recent years** have more frequent captures (12-20 per year)
- Scrubber **snaps to closest available** release

### "What's the difference between the two timelines?"

**Wayback Slider (middle):**
- Controls which **satellite imagery** you see
- 186 releases from 2014-2025
- Gray lines show available imagery dates

**Site Timeline (bottom):**
- Shows when **sites were destroyed**
- Red dots are destruction events
- Same timeline as Dashboard page

### "Why does 'Sync map on dot click' sometimes jump to unexpected dates?"

The system finds the **first available Wayback release AFTER** the destruction date.

**Example:**
- Site destroyed: October 15, 2023
- Next available imagery: November 3, 2023
- Green scrubber jumps to Nov 3 (closest imagery showing aftermath)

**Why?**
- Satellites don't capture every day
- System picks earliest post-destruction evidence
- You can manually adjust scrubbers if needed

### "Can I see the exact date of each satellite image?"

**Yes!** Three ways:
1. **Hover** over Wayback Slider → Tooltip shows date
2. **Look at date label** on map (top center)
3. **Drag scrubber** → Date label updates in real-time

### "How do I zoom to a site without Comparison Mode jumping around?"

**Two options:**
1. **Turn OFF "Zoom to Site"** in map settings (bottom-left)
   - Manually zoom/pan to area you want
   - Click sites → They highlight, but map stays put

2. **Use Custom interval**
   - Set Comparison Interval to "Custom"
   - Click site
   - Scrubbers won't auto-jump
   - Manually adjust as needed

### "What does 'Adaptive zoom' mean in the date labels?"

**Background:**
- ESRI Wayback imagery quality varies by date
- Recent imagery (2022+): Higher resolution → Zoom level 18
- Older imagery (pre-2022): Lower resolution → Zoom level 17

**What you see:**
- System automatically adjusts zoom based on imagery date
- You don't need to do anything
- Ensures best viewing experience

### "Can I compare two dates from the same year?"

**Yes!**
1. Enable Comparison Mode
2. Set interval to "Custom"
3. Drag yellow scrubber to first date
4. Drag green scrubber to second date
5. Both scrubbers move independently

**Example:** Compare January 2024 vs. March 2024

## Map Settings Explained

Each map has two toggles in the **bottom-left corner**:

### ☑ Zoom to Site

**When ON:**
- Clicking a site → Map automatically zooms to that location
- Useful for quick exploration of multiple sites

**When OFF:**
- Clicking a site → Site highlights, but map stays at current zoom/position
- Useful when comparing multiple sites in one area

**Tip:** Turn OFF when investigating a neighborhood with multiple sites.

### ☑ Show Map Markers

**When ON:**
- All filtered sites show as colored markers
- Colors indicate status (red = destroyed, etc.)
- Useful for spatial context

**When OFF:**
- Only selected site marker appears
- Clearer satellite imagery (no clutter)
- Useful for examining fine details

**Tip:** Turn OFF for presentations/screenshots - cleaner imagery.
