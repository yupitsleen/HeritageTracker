**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Document sources for human casualty statistics displayed on Statistics page

## Current Statistics (November 2025)

### Deaths

**Official Reported Figure:** 68,643+ Palestinians killed (as of October 29, 2025)

**Sources:**
- **Primary Source:** Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH)
- **UN Verification:** UN OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)
- **Reported by:** UNRWA Situation Reports

**Breakdown:**
- Approximately 70% women and children (consistently reported across UN sources)
- These are confirmed deaths with identified bodies and documentation

**Important Context:**
- The Lancet (January 2025 peer-reviewed study) estimated actual deaths from traumatic injury may be **41% higher** than reported figures

  - Bodies under rubble (estimated 10,000+)
  - Indirect deaths from disease, malnutrition, lack of medical care
  - Missing persons presumed dead

**Why Lower Than Reality:**
- Health system collapse preventing documentation
- Bodies buried under rubble inaccessible
- Mass graves discovered but not fully counted
- Indirect deaths (starvation, disease, lack of medicine) not included in official toll

## Source Reliability Assessment

### Gaza Ministry of Health

**Authority:**
- Official Palestinian health authority in Gaza
- Operated since 2007
- Maintains hospital records, morgue records, family reports

**International Recognition:**
- UN agencies cite MoH figures as most reliable available
- WHO considers MoH data credible
- Human Rights Watch validates methodology
- Historical accuracy: MoH figures from previous conflicts matched or were lower than final verified counts

**Methodology:**
- Counts only identified bodies with documentation
- Requires: Name, ID number, date/place of death
- Does NOT include:
  - Bodies under rubble
  - Missing persons
  - Indirect deaths (disease, starvation, medical care denial)
- Conservative counting method = likely undercount

**NOT Israeli Sources:**
- Israeli military estimates are consistently 50-70% lower
- International organizations do NOT consider Israeli figures credible
- MoH is Palestinian, not Israeli

### UN Agencies (OCHA, UNRWA, WHO)

**Role:**
- Relay MoH figures to international community
- Add verification through:
  - Hospital visits
  - Field reports
  - Satellite imagery analysis
  - Cross-referencing multiple sources

**Transparency:**
- OCHA states: "We relay but do not independently verify casualty figures"
- UN explicitly trusts MoH methodology based on historical accuracy
- WHO validates health system reporting

**Documents:**
- UNRWA Situation Reports (updated 2-3 times weekly)
- OCHA Humanitarian Situation Updates
- WHO Public Health Situation Analysis

**Current Best Estimate (Nov 11, 2025):** **69,000+** confirmed deaths, likely **70,000-97,000** actual deaths including indirect casualties and those under rubble.

## Academic and Independent Research

### The Lancet Study (January 2025)

**Citation:** Peer-reviewed medical journal
**Finding:** Gaza MoH undercounted traumatic injury deaths by **41%**
**Estimated True Toll (as of Oct 2024):** 70,000+ vs. reported 41,909
**Methodology:** Statistical modeling, hospital records analysis, epidemiological methods

### Brown University - Costs of War Project (October 2025)

**Report:** "The Human Toll of the Gaza War"
**URL:** https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/
**Findings:**
- Direct deaths: 67,000+ (confirmed)
- Indirect deaths (disease, starvation, medical denial): potentially equal or exceed direct deaths
- Total excess mortality: 120,000-186,000 estimated range

### Tech for Palestine - Palestine Datasets

**Project:** Data aggregation and tracking
**URL:** https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/killed-in-gaza/
**Methodology:**
- Aggregates MoH daily reports
- Cross-references media reports
- Tracks demographic breakdowns
- Open-source, transparent methodology

## Why NOT Use Israeli Sources

### Israeli Military Estimates

**Typical Claims:**
- 15,000-20,000 deaths (vs. 69,000+ verified)
- "50% Hamas combatants" (unverified, disputed)
- No methodology transparency
- No international verification

**International Rejection:**
- UN does not cite Israeli figures
- Human rights organizations reject as propaganda
- Historical precedent: Israeli counts consistently 50-70% lower than verified post-conflict counts

**Why They're Lower:**
- Political motivation to minimize perception of civilian casualties
- Classification games (calling civilians "combatants")
- No access to Gaza health system or morgues
- No documentation methodology

### What International Law Experts Say

**General Principle:** In asymmetric conflicts, the side suffering casualties has more accurate counts because they have:
- Access to bodies
- Hospital records
- Family reports
- Documentation infrastructure

The attacking side (Israel) has:
- Political incentive to undercount
- No access to civilian casualty documentation
- Propaganda interest in claiming "precision" strikes

---

## Comparison: Historical Accuracy

### 2014 Gaza War (Operation Protective Edge)

**Initial Gaza MoH Count:** 2,251 Palestinian deaths
**Final UN Verified Count:** 2,251 deaths
**Accuracy:** 100% match

**Initial Israeli Military Count:** ~1,000 deaths
**Final UN Verified Count:** 2,251 deaths
**Accuracy:** 55% undercount

**Pattern:** Gaza MoH accurate, Israeli military significantly undercount.

## Ethical Considerations

### Why These Numbers Matter

**Cultural Erasure Context:**
- Genocide destroys both people AND their culture
- Heritage destruction is not separate from human casualties—it's part of the same systematic erasure
- Our site documents cultural heritage destruction, but must acknowledge the human toll as context

**Number Fatigue:**
- Large numbers can become abstract
- Important to humanize: "70% women and children"
- Important to contextualize: "90% of population displaced"
- Important to compare: "Equivalent to [familiar city]"

### Avoiding Politicization

**What We Do:**
- Cite authoritative, internationally recognized sources
- Use conservative estimates (official counts, not projections)
- Provide transparent methodology
- Update regularly with dated sources

**What We Avoid:**
- Editorializing ("massacre," "slaughter"—let numbers speak)
- Using contested figures without qualification
- Citing single-source or unverified claims
- Mixing casualty types (direct vs. indirect) without clear labeling
