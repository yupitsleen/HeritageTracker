# Tracking Palestinian Cultural Heritage Displacement: Feasibility Study

**Research conducted:** October 2025  
**Compiled by:** Claude (Anthropic) in collaboration with project team  
**Purpose:** Feasibility research for Palestinian Heritage Tracker web application

---

## Executive Summary

The landscape of looted Palestinian cultural heritage is both staggering in scale and remarkably well-documented. Approximately 120,000 artifacts have been smuggled from Palestinian territories since 1967, with an additional 70,000 books systematically taken in 1948 now marked "AP" (Abandoned Property) in Israeli institutions. Multiple existing databases and documentation projects provide immediately actionable data sources for building a public tracking application.

**For the MVP, we focus exclusively on Gaza Heritage Destruction (2023-2024):**

- 110 sites officially verified by UNESCO
- 207 of 320 total sites damaged or destroyed (64.7%)
- Clean, structured data from three authoritative sources
- Highly timely and visually compelling
- Can be completed in 3-4 weeks

This matters because cultural heritage displacement represents a systematic erasure of Palestinian history and identity that continues today. 60% of Gaza's 320 archaeological sites were damaged or destroyed in just six months of the 2023-2024 conflict. Building a tracking application would aggregate scattered documentation into a single accessible resource.

## 1. What Was Taken: A Systematic Campaign Spanning 77 Years

### The 1948 Nakba: The Great Book Robbery

Israeli forces systematically collected approximately **70,000 books from Palestinian homes** during the conquest of West Jerusalem, with around 30,000 still held at the Israeli National Library today, marked with the euphemistic "AP" stamp. The operation was documented from its inception—a letter from library director Curt Wormann dated April 25, 1948, shows this was coordinated with government and army support.

**Named Collections Include:**

- **Khalil Sakakini Library** (~5,000 books): The renowned Palestinian educator and poet fled Jerusalem in 1948. His daughters Hala and her aunt visited the Israeli National Library in 1967 and found their father's books with his handwritten marginalia, cataloged with his "SAK" signature before being systematically relabeled "AP" in the 1960s to erase ownership records.

- **Omar Saleh Barghouti Collection** (256 books including personal diaries)

- **Mohammad Nimer Al-Khatib Collection**

- **Dr. Yusuf Haikel Collection**

- **Khalil Rassas's Photographic Archives**

In 1958, Israeli authorities destroyed 27,000 additional Palestinian textbooks from the pre-1948 period, ordering them sold to paper mills as "useless or threatening."

### Archives and Cultural Institutions

Archives faced wholesale appropriation during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The **Palestinian Cinema Institute's entire archive** documenting Palestinian life in refugee camps from the late 1960s to early 1980s was looted and remains in Israeli military archives, classified as restricted. The Palestine Research Center's collection was seized—materials are now cataloged under the non-existent "PLO Archive" designation, obscuring their institutional origins. Half a million books in private Palestinian collections were taken.

### Archaeological Artifacts

The Blakhiyya archaeological site in Gaza—an ancient seaport spanning 800 BCE to 1100 CE—had a warehouse containing **4,000+ archaeological objects seized by the Israeli army** during the 2023-2024 war. The Byzantine "King David Playing the Lyre" mosaic was removed from Gaza City in 1974 by the Israel Antiquity Authority and now resides in the Israel Museum's synagogue section.

The Palestinian Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage documents that **120,000 objects have been smuggled** out of Palestine since 1967, facilitated by Israeli control over 60% of the West Bank (Area C) where Palestinians cannot explore or safeguard heritage sites.

### Religious and Architectural Heritage

Of Palestine's 313 large mosques in 1948, 200 fell within areas that became Israel. At least 100 were completely demolished along with the villages that housed them, while 140 were abandoned. Many remaining mosques were converted: the Al-Wihda mosque in Jaffa became a synagogue, Al-Siksik became a Bulgarian restaurant and nightclub.

A comprehensive Al-Aqsa Foundation survey documented **2,350 Islamic and Christian holy sites desecrated** in territories occupied in 1948.

### Gaza 2023-2024: Unprecedented Destruction

The 2023-2024 Gaza war resulted in documented destruction of **207 out of 320 archaeological sites and buildings of cultural significance** (64.7%), verified by UNESCO and Palestinian authorities.

**Major sites destroyed include:**

- Great Omari Mosque (7th century) - 62 rare manuscripts from 14th century destroyed
- Church of St. Porphyrius (5th century) - world's third-oldest church
- Saint Hilarion Monastery - founded 1,700 years ago
- Qasr Al-Basha (13th century) - Mamluk palace/museum
- Al Qarara Museum - 3,000 artifacts
- Rafah Museum - 30 years of collecting

## 7. Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Data Challenges

**Challenge:** Fragmented sources across multiple institutions
**Mitigation:** Start with narrow scope (20-25 sites), expand gradually

**Challenge:** Some data behind access restrictions
**Mitigation:** Use only publicly accessible sources for MVP

**Challenge:** Ongoing destruction makes data quickly outdated
**Mitigation:** Version data with timestamps, plan for regular updates

### Technical Challenges

**Challenge:** Map performance with many markers
**Mitigation:** Start with 20-25 sites, implement clustering if expanding

**Challenge:** Large image files
**Mitigation:** Optimize images, use CDN (Cloudinary free tier), lazy loading

### Political/Legal Challenges

**Challenge:** Accusations of bias or political advocacy
**Mitigation:** Strict adherence to verified sources, transparent methodology, clear disclaimers

**Challenge:** Potential takedown requests
**Mitigation:** Host on platform with strong legal protections, document everything thoroughly

**Challenge:** Israeli sources may object to inclusion
**Mitigation:** Use only international/Palestinian sources for MVP, cite everything meticulously

## 9. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment: HIGHLY FEASIBLE

**Strengths:**
✅ Excellent data availability from authoritative sources
✅ Clear, manageable MVP scope (20-25 sites)
✅ Strong legal frameworks supporting mission
✅ Timely and urgent subject matter
✅ Technical implementation is straightforward
✅ Potential for significant impact

**Path Forward:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Set up repository, create issues, begin data collection
2. **Week 3-4:** Build core map and timeline features
3. **Week 5-6:** Add detail panels, polish UI/UX, ensure accessibility
4. **Week 7-8:** Beta testing, gather feedback, prepare launch
5. **Week 9:** Public launch with media outreach

**Critical Success Factors:**

- Maintain strict adherence to verified sources
- Ensure professional, documentary approach
- Build for accessibility and mobile from day one
- Plan for Arabic language support early
- Partner with Palestinian organizations for validation

**This project fills a genuine gap** in publicly accessible cultural heritage documentation. The infrastructure exists, the data exists, the legal frameworks exist. What's needed is synthesis and presentation in an accessible, visual format that makes the full scope of displacement undeniable.

The timing is critical: destruction is ongoing, documentation is happening in real-time, and public awareness is high. A well-executed MVP launched within 2 months could become an essential resource for researchers, advocates, educators, and the public.
