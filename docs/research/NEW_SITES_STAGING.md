## Research Priorities

### Phase 1: High Priority (Clear UNESCO sites)
- Ibn Othman Mosque - Full details available
- Shaikh Zakaria Mosque - Partial details
- Religious sites with names (Al-Mughrabi, Sett Ruqayya, etc.)
- Named monuments (Unknown Soldier Memorial, etc.)
- Named buildings (Old Gaza Municipality, cinemas, etc.)

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Named houses)
- Hani Saba House
- Raghib Al-Alami House
- Research remaining named houses

### Phase 3: Lower Priority (Unnamed structures)
- 70+ residential/commercial historic buildings
- May need to research individually or group as "Historic Gaza City Buildings"

### Phase 4: Verification Needed
- Sites from Al Jazeera not in UNESCO list
- Cross-reference with Heritage for Peace
- Sites already in database that aren't in UNESCO list

---

## Next Steps

1. **Research individual sites** - Get coordinates, dates, descriptions for high-priority sites
2. **Format data** - Create GazaSite objects for each new site
3. **Validate** - Cross-reference with multiple sources
4. **Update mockSites.ts** - Add new sites to array
5. **Update progress tracker** - Log completion
