# Gaza Heritage Historical Expansion Plan (1948-2023)

**Created:** 2025-11-16
**Purpose:** Document potential sites to add to Heritage Tracker dataset from Nakba through pre-genocide period
**Current Dataset:** 70 sites (2023-2024 Gaza genocide period)
**Expansion Target:** Add 50-100+ sites from 1948-2023 period

---

## Constraints & Challenges

### Known Limitations

1. **Documentation Gaps**
   - First/Second Intifada may have limited heritage documentation
   - 1956 Suez Crisis poorly documented for heritage
   - Pre-1948 Gaza sites may lack specific names

2. **Source Accessibility**
   - Some archives require institutional access
   - Palestinian government archives may be difficult to access
   - Israeli military archives are classified

3. **Verification Standards**
   - Must maintain 3-source minimum for credibility
   - Some historical sites may only have oral testimony
   - Coordinate precision decreases for older sites

4. **Scope Management**
   - Focus on Gaza Strip only (exclude West Bank)
   - Prioritize documented destruction over "at risk" sites
   - Balance comprehensive coverage vs. verification quality

## Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with research, clarify:

1. **Priority:** Which conflict period is most important to document first?
2. **Scope:** Include looted artifacts currently in Israeli institutions?
3. **Sources:** Acceptable to use oral histories for pre-1948 sites with limited documentation?
4. **Timeline:** What's the target completion date for historical expansion?
5. **Collaboration:** Plan to work with Palestinian heritage organizations?
