## Risk Mitigation

**Risks:**
1. i18n taking longer than 4-5 days
2. Complex interactions between registries
3. Breaking changes in existing code

**Mitigation:**
1. Can defer full i18n to post-backend if needed
2. Comprehensive integration tests
3. Maintain backward compatibility throughout

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Issue #21: Enhanced Date Parsing (6-8 hours)
2. Issue #22: Verifier Registry (3-4 hours)
3. Issue #12: Animation Speed Config (3-4 hours)

**Session 1 Goal:** Complete Sprint 1, Day 1 (Issues #21, #22)
**Session 2 Goal:** Complete Sprint 1, Days 2-3 (Issues #12, #14, #16)
