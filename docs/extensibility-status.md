## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Remaining Quick Wins (Recommended)

**Small remaining issues (1-2 days total):**

1. **Issue #15: Timeline Date Config** - 0.5 day, +10 tests
2. **Issue #18: Marker Icon CDN** - 0.25 day, +8 tests
3. **Issue #23: Marker Responsive Config** - 0.25 day, +8 tests
4. **Issue #24: Table Variants Registry** - 0.5 day, +12 tests
5. **Issue #26: Frame Rate Config** - 0.25 day, +8 tests
6. **Issue #27: Component Class Names** - 0.5 day, +10 tests

**Total:** ~2.25 days, +56 tests ‚Üí Would bring us to 1171 tests and 22/27 issues (81.5%)

### Option 2: Push Current Work & Create PR
- Current branch has 267 new tests and 6 complete issues
- This is substantial, cohesive work (Sprints 2 & 3)
- Good stopping point for review
- Can continue on fresh branch after merge

### Option 3: Tackle i18n (Issue #3)
- 4-5 day effort
- CRITICAL priority
- Can be deferred to post-backend if needed
- Requires full focus and testing

## üìà Test Coverage Progression

**Starting Point (feat/UItweaks3 merged):** 848 tests
**After Sprint 2 (Map Config):** 983 tests (+135)
**After Sprint 3 (Theme & Visual):** 1115 tests (+132)

**Projection with remaining work:**
- If Issues #14, #16 already done: ~1160 tests
- After small remaining issues: ~1210 tests
- After i18n (Issue #3): ~1250 tests
- **Final estimated: 1250-1300 tests** (up from 848 = 47-53% increase!)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Issues #14 and #16 may already be complete** - Need to verify based on commit history (commits 1325dc5, 85cdcf5, feb7ba5)

2. **Issue #3 (i18n) is the remaining CRITICAL item** but can be deferred post-backend

3. **Current branch feat/sprint2-extensibility is ready for PR** with 267 new tests

4. **All backward compatibility maintained** - No breaking changes introduced

---

## üîÑ Next Session Recommendations

### Recommended Path: Complete Remaining Small Issues

**6 small issues remaining (~2.25 days):**

- Issue #15: Timeline Date Config (0.5 day, +10 tests)
- Issue #18: Marker Icon CDN (0.25 day, +8 tests)
- Issue #23: Marker Responsive Config (0.25 day, +8 tests)
- Issue #24: Table Variants Registry (0.5 day, +12 tests)
- Issue #26: Frame Rate Config (0.25 day, +8 tests)
- Issue #27: Component Class Names (0.5 day, +10 tests)

Then only Issue #3 (i18n Architecture - 4-5 days) remains as the final large effort.

---

**Summary:** We're **59.3% complete** (16/27 issues), with **90% of backend prep done** and map/visual systems fully mature. The main remaining work is 6 small polish items (2-3 days) plus i18n (4-5 days).
